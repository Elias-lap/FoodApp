# React + Vite

Welcome to our project repository! ðŸš€ We're excited to present a dynamic web application built with React, Bootstrap, and Vite, facilitating CRUD operations for managing recipes. This project allows both admins and users to interact seamlessly, with admins having the privilege to perform CRUD operations on recipes, while users can add recipes to their favorites and remove them. Leveraging the power of React for frontend interactivity and Bootstrap for responsive design, coupled with Vite for lightning-fast development, we've created an intuitive platform for culinary enthusiasts to explore, share, and manage their favourite recipes effortlessly. Our commitment to clean code, efficient data handling, and a delightful user experience drives this project forward.
